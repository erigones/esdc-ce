NOTE: Signals are great and we are using them to start subsequent processes.
(e.g. create monitoring host after VM is defined)
However, extra caution is required. Example: An _atomic_ view can create a VM, which is actually saved in the DB after
the view is done. But during the view, a signal is called, which loads the VM from DB. The signal function may not find
the VM in the DB because the parent view is still running...
