This is firewall config directory.

Files from this directory are used to generate
these config files at boot:
/etc/ipf/ipf.conf
/etc/ipf/ipnat.conf
/etc/ipf/ipf6.conf

It is intended for two things:
1. restore fw config from a permanent storage at boot
2. allow splitting the fw config into multiple files

# This directory is searched by the script
/opt/custom/etc/rc-pre-network.d/010-ipf-restore.sh

The script looks for files starting with the name
of the respective conf file.

E.g. for output file /etc/ipf/ipf.conf
it matches either ipf.conf or
ipf.conf-001, ipf.conf-002, ipf.conf-999, etc.
(you can use here either a single file or split
the config into multiple files)

Examples: 
ipf.conf-005 ipf.conf-010 ...
ipnat.conf-005 ipnat.conf-010 ...
ipf6.conf-005 ipf6.conf-010 ...

If no respective matching files exist, the firewall
config is not touched.
